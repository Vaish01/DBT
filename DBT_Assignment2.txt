Que4.Why isn't possible to see the first five rows of a table?

Ans.In RDBMS, table is not a file, every row is a file.Rows of a table are not stored sequentially.
    The rows of the table are scattered or fragmented all over the database server hard disk.
    When you insert into a table,wherever the system(RDBMS) finds the free space in the database server it will store the row
    there.Therefore,the order of rows in the output depends on the row address.
